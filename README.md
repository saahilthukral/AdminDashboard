# AdminDashboard

This is an Admin Dashboard created purely from HTML and CSS.
This project uses a combination of grids and flexbox, which ensured a smooth sailing progress

Along with this, I also used positioning to fix the layout for certain elements such as the buttons.

I am still facing issues with fixing the height of the Dashboard, so that it can fit the comple browser page, and fixing the layout a bit more to make it appear more cohesive, but overall, this was one of the more simpler projects in terms of positioning elememts and having a general idea of achieving the desired layout.
